Two types of models:
    - SVM classifier
    - Naive Bayes classifier

Features:
    - Summary features already generated by Lu
    - TD-IDF representation
    - Number of clauses
    - Lexical diversity (similar to TF-IDF)
    - Typo ratio (need to be able to identify typos)
    (See feature_list.xlsx in Teams files for full list)

PySpark or Python
    - If we have performance issues we may want to look into "online learning" or streaming
    - Need to see if we can build an SVM with PySpark if we have issues with performance
    - Could potentially use cloud services if our local machines are unable to run everything fast enough
        - Does GTech have credits for AWS or any other cloud providers?

TODO:
- Review papers for other features
- Begin generating some of the features identified
- SVM/Naive-Bayes for PySpark (how feasible/easy is this to implement?)



To install the packages to perform preprocessing, you need to make sure you download the correct model for spacy:
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
For part-of-speech tag, make sure to do this:
    nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
